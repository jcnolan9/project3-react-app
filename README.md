# Keep In Touch App

## Description
For this project I build an app that allows a user to sign-up and login to the app. Once logged in, the user can input information about their contacts (first name, last name, email & phone number) and create reminders for when to get in touch with those contacts and the prefered way for doing so (e.g. text, email, phone call). Users are able to see list of all their reminders while logged in. 

The backend of the app was built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and GraphQL. 

The front-end uses React, CSS, and GraphQL.
